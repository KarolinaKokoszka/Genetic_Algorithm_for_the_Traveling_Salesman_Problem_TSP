# Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_TSP
This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve the TSP â€” finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. It includes customizable selection, crossover, and mutation strategies, with visualizations of route evolution and optimization progress over generations.
